响应: Here’s the structured analysis of the provided code, categorized by the type of spatial query and the method used to compute the target position:

---

### **Template/Category 1: Absolute Position Adjustment**

**Definition**: Queries where the target position is calculated by adjusting a given absolute coordinate along a specific axis.

- `# Query: a point 10cm in front of [10, 15, 60]`
  Adjusts `x` by +10cm from fixed coordinates `[10, 15, 60]`.
- `# Query: a point 10cm to the right of [45 49 66], and 5cm above it`
  Adjusts `y` (+10cm) and `z` (+5cm) from fixed coordinates `[45, 49, 66]`.

### **Template/Category 2: Object-Relative Position (Axis-Aligned)**

**Definition**: Queries where the target is computed relative to an object's bounding box (AABB) or center, using axis-aligned offsets.

- `# Query: a point on the right side of the table`
  Uses `max_y` of the table’s AABB.
- `# Query: a point 20cm on top of the container`
  Uses `max_z` of the container’s AABB + 20cm.
- `# Query: a point 1cm to the left of the brown block`
  Uses `min_y` of the block’s AABB - 1cm.
- `# Query: a point on the back side of the table`
  Uses `min_x` of the table’s AABB.
- `# Query: a point on the front right corner of the table`
  Uses `max_x` and `max_y` of the table’s AABB.
- `# Query: a point 5cm above the blue block`
  Uses `max_z` of the block’s AABB + 5cm.
- `# Query: a point 4cm to the left of and 10cm on top of the tray`
  Uses `min_y` (-4cm) and `max_z` (+10cm) of the tray’s AABB.
- `# Query: a point 10cm above and 5cm to the left of the yellow bowl`
  Uses `min_y` (-5cm) and `max_z` (+10cm) of the bowl’s AABB.

---

### **Template/Category 3: Object-Relative Position (Directional Normal)**

**Definition**: Queries where the target is computed using the object’s surface normal for directional offsets.

- `# Query: a point 30cm into the topmost drawer handle`
  Uses `-normal` of the handle to move "into" it.
- `# Query: a point 20cm away from the leftmost block`
  Uses `normal` of the block to move "away" from it.

---

### **Template/Category 4: Radial/Volumetric Position**

**Definition**: Queries where the target is a region (voxels) within a radius of an object.

- `# Query: anywhere within 20cm of the right most block`
  Uses `set_voxel_by_radius` to fill a spherical region around the block.

---

### **Template/Category 5: Direct Object Reference**

**Definition**: Queries where the target is the object itself or its intrinsic properties.

- `# Query: the blue circle`
  Directly uses the object’s `occupancy_map`.
- `# Query: a point at the center of the blue circle`
  Uses the object’s `position` without offsets.

---

### **Key Observations**:

1. **Axis-Aligned vs. Normal-Based**:
   - Most queries use axis-aligned offsets (e.g., `max_y`, `min_z`).
   - Two queries (`topmost drawer handle`, `leftmost block`) use surface normals for directional movement.
2. **Single-Point vs. Region**:
   - Most queries set a single voxel, while one (`within 20cm`) fills a volumetric region.
3. **Redundancy**:
   - Queries like "above" or "to the left" follow repetitive patterns (e.g., `max_z + offset`, `min_y - offset`).
   - Normal-based queries could be generalized further (e.g., `move_along_normal(object, distance, inward=False)`).

This categorization helps streamline future implementations by grouping similar logic (e.g., AABB-based offsets) into reusable functions.
