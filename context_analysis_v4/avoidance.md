### Identified Templates/Categories:

1. **'a {distance} cm {spatial_relation} the {object}'**:
   Defines a spatial avoidance zone around a specific object.

   - _Classified context parts_:
     - "10cm from the bowl"
     - "20cm near the mug"
     - "10cm from the blue circle"
   - _Reason_: All involve setting a radial distance (cm) relative to a named object (bowl, mug, blue circle).
   - _Reusable Template_:
     ```python
     avoidance_map = get_empty_avoidance_map()
     {object} = parse_query_obj('{object}')
     set_voxel_by_radius(avoidance_map, {object}.position, radius_cm={distance}, value=1)
     ret_val = avoidance_map
     ```

2. **'a {distance} cm {spatial_relation} the {adjective} {object_type}'**:
   Defines avoidance zones around objects filtered by a property (e.g., fragility).

   - _Classified context part_:
     - "10cm from anything fragile"
   - _Reason_: Uses a descriptive property ("fragile") to dynamically select objects.
   - _Reusable Template_:
     ```python
     avoidance_map = get_empty_avoidance_map()
     {property}_objects = parse_query_obj('anything {property}')
     for obj in {property}_objects:
         set_voxel_by_radius(avoidance_map, obj.position, radius_cm={distance}, value=1)
     ret_val = avoidance_map
     ```

3. **'a {distance1} cm {spatial_relation} the {object1} and {distance2} cm {spatial_relation} the {object2}'**:
   Combines multiple avoidance zones for distinct objects in one query.
   - _Classified context part_:
     - "20cm around the mug and 10cm around the bowl"
   - _Reason_: Multi-object query with independent radii.
   - _Reusable Template_:
     ```python
     avoidance_map = get_empty_avoidance_map()
     {object1} = parse_query_obj('{object1}')
     set_voxel_by_radius(avoidance_map, {object1}.position, radius_cm={distance1}, value=1)
     {object2} = parse_query_obj('{object2}')
     set_voxel_by_radius(avoidance_map, {object2}.position, radius_cm={distance2}, value=1)
     ret_val = avoidance_map
     ```

### Suggested New Tasks:

1. **"5cm above the red cube"**:
   Avoidance zone _above_ (instead of radial) a colored object.
2. **"15cm from all moving objects"**:
   Dynamic avoidance based on object motion (requires motion detection integration).
3. **"30cm between the laptop and the cup"**:
   Avoidance zone spanning two objects (e.g., a path or buffer zone).

### Key Observations:

- **Spatial Relations**: Current queries use "from," "near," and "around" interchangeably. Standardizing terms (e.g., "within," "outside") could improve clarity.
- **Extensions**: Templates could support 3D relations (e.g., "below"), dynamic properties (e.g., "hot"), or compound logic (e.g., "fragile AND tall").
- **Error Handling**: No examples handle missing objects; templates could include `if {object} exists` checks.

This structure ensures adaptability for future avoidance-map queries while minimizing redundancy.
