#Query: slide the drill towards the hot soup
Here's the response to the query "slide the drill towards the hot soup":

```
composer("push the drill towards the hot soup while keeping at least 15cm away from the hot soup")
```

This command will:
1. Push the drill in the direction of the hot soup
2. Maintain a safe distance of at least 15cm from the hot soup to avoid any potential hazards
3. Use the pushing action rather than grasping since we just want to slide the object

#Query: sweep the steak into the box
Here's the response for sweeping the steak into the box:

```
composer("grasp the broom")
composer("back to default pose")
composer("push the steak into the box")
```

This sequence:
1. First picks up the broom
2. Returns to a neutral position
3. Uses the broom to push/sweep the steak into the box

The broom is the most appropriate tool for sweeping actions, and this sequence ensures we have control of the broom before attempting to move the steak. The "push" action with the broom will effectively sweep the steak into the desired box.

#Query: unplug the drawer handle from the broom
It seems there might be some confusion in the query. The drawer handle and broom are not typically objects that would be plugged or unplugged from each other. 

Could you clarify or rephrase your request? For example:
- If you want to disconnect the broom from a holder: "Detach the broom from its holder"
- If you want to remove the drawer handle: "Remove the drawer handle"

Let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can provide the appropriate action sequence.

#Query: unplug the bowl from the broom
I'm sorry, but I cannot perform the action "unplug the bowl from the broom" because:
1. Bowls and brooms are not designed to be plugged/unplugged - they don't have compatible connection mechanisms
2. There is no logical way these objects would be physically connected in a plug/unplug manner
3. The request doesn't make physical sense in a real-world context

Would you like me to help with a different task involving these objects? For example:
- Moving the bowl
- Using the broom
- Placing the bowl somewhere else

#Query: unplug the plate from the broom
I'm sorry, but the objects "plate" and "broom" don't have any natural connection that would allow for "unplugging" one from the other. This query doesn't make physical sense as:

1. Plates aren't typically plugged into anything
2. Brooms don't have any components that would connect to plates
3. There's no standard way these objects interact that would involve "unplugging"

Would you like to:
- Rephrase the query to describe a more plausible action (like "move the plate away from the broom")
- Or clarify what you mean by "unplug" in this context?

#Query: unplug the plate from the bread
I'm sorry, but the query "unplug the plate from the bread" doesn't make logical sense in this context. Plates and bread don't have a plug/unplug relationship. 

Could you please:

2. Describe the actual objects and their arrangement?
3. Explain what you're trying to accomplish?

This will help me provide the appropriate robotic actions to achieve your goal.

1. Grasp the tray
2. Lift it away from the bread
3. Place it elsewhere

#Query: unplug the plate from the outlet
I'm sorry, but I cannot unplug the plate from the outlet because plates are not electrical devices that can be plugged in. Plates are typically used for serving food and don't have plugs or electrical connections. 

Is there something else you'd like me to help with regarding the plate or outlet? For example, I could:
1. Move the plate away from the outlet if it's too close
2. Place the plate in a different location
3. Or help with any other objects in the scene

It seems there might be some confusion in the query. The objects mentioned ("bowl" and "bread") don't have a typical plug/unplug relationship like electrical devices would. 

Could you clarify what you'd like to accomplish? For example:
- If you want to separate the bowl from the bread, I could help move one away from the other
- If there's some other relationship between these objects, please describe what you'd like to do

Some possible interpretations:
1. "Remove the bowl from on top of the bread"
2. "Take the bread out of the bowl"
3. "Move the bowl away from the bread"

Please let me know which action you'd like performed or clarify the request.

3. Finally, we'll return to a neutral position:
composer("back to default pose")

This sequence will slide the beer cap in the direction of the bottle while maintaining a safe and controlled motion. The pushing action will be performed with appropriate force to move the cap without crushing it.
#Query: slide the grill towards the drill
objects = ['grill', 'drill']
# Query: slide the grill towards the drill
composer("push the grill towards the drill")
# done
#Query: unplug the drawer handle from the outlet
It seems there is a misunderstanding in the query. The "drawer handle" cannot be unplugged from an "outlet" as they are not compatible objects for this action. 

If you meant to unplug something else from the outlet (like a charger or appliance), please clarify the object to be unplugged. 

Alternatively, if you meant to manipulate the drawer or outlet separately, please specify the correct action (e.g., "open the drawer" or "unplug [object] from the outlet"). 

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
#Query: slide the beer cap towards the switch
objects = ['beer cap', 'switch']
# Query: slide the beer cap towards the switch
composer("push the beer cap towards the switch")
# done
#Query: unplug the drawer handle from the bread
It seems there is some confusion in the query. The objects mentioned are "drawer handle" and "bread", but unplugging a drawer handle from bread doesn't make logical sense. 

Could you please clarify or rephrase your request? For example:
- If you meant to open a drawer, I could help with that
- If you meant to move bread away from a drawer, I could assist with that
- Or if you had a different intention, please let me know

The current objects don't appear to have a logical connection for an "unplugging" action.

#Query: unplug the tray from the broom
I'm sorry, but I cannot perform that action. The tray is not plugged into the broom - they are separate objects that are not connected in that way. 

The objects mentioned are:
- marbles
- tray 
- broom

If you'd like me to perform a different action with these objects, such as sweeping the marbles into the tray or moving the tray, I'd be happy to help with that. For example:

"Could you move the tray to the left of the broom?"
or
"Please sweep the marbles into the tray using the broom."

Would you like me to perform one of these actions instead?
